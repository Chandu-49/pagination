        <p>Kane Stuart Williamson (born 8 August 1990)[1] is a New Zealand international cricketer and captain of the New Zealand national team in limited overs cricket. On 27 February 2023, Williamson became the all-time leading run-scorer for New Zealand in Test cricket.[2] A right-handed batsman and an occasional off spin bowler, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest contemporary batsmen and captains New Zealand has ever produced and the greatest New Zealand batsman of all time. He captained New Zealand to victory in the 2021 ICC World Test Championship final.</p>
        <h3>EARLY AND PERSONAL LIFE</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Williamson was born on 8 August 1990 in Tauranga, New Zealand.[12] His father Brett was a sales representative who had played under-17 and club cricket in New Zealand and his mother Sandra had been a representative basketball player. He has a twin brother Logan, who is one minute younger than him. The brothers have three older sisters, Anna, Kylie and Sophie. All three were accomplished volleyball players, and Anna and Sophie were in New Zealand age group teams. Williamson's grandmother Joan Williamson-Orr served as mayor of Taupō. His first cousin Dane Cleaver has also played international cricket for New Zealand.[13]

            Williamson played senior representative cricket at the age of 14 and first-class cricket at 16. He attended Tauranga Boys' College from 2004 to 2008, where he was head boy in his final year. He was coached by Pacey Depina who described Williamson as having "a thirst to be phenomenal – but not at anyone else's expense."[14][15] He reportedly scored 40 centuries before he left school.[16]</p>
        
        <h3>INTERNATIONAL CARRER</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Williamson was 17, when he led the New Zealand Under-19 side in the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. New Zealand reached the semi-final, where they lost to the eventual champions India. On 24 March 2010, Williamson was named in the New Zealand Test squad for the second Test against Australia,[33] but ultimately he did not play in the match.[34]

            Williamson made his One-Day International debut against India on 10 August 2010. He was dismissed for a 9th ball duck. In his second match, he was bowled by Angelo Mathews for a second ball duck. He scored his maiden ODI century against Bangladesh on 14 October 2010 in Dhaka and hence became the youngest centurion in New Zealand's cricket history. Due to his performance on the Bangladesh tour where New Zealand suffered a 4–0 whitewash, Williamson was selected in the New Zealand Test squad for the tour of India that followed.[35]
            
            Williamson made his Test cricket debut against India at Ahmedabad on 4 November 2010. In his first innings he scored 131 runs off 299 balls and became the eighth New Zealand player to score a century on Test debut.[36][37]
            
            Rising through the ranks
            Williamson scored 161* against West Indies in June 2014, his second century of the series and helped secure a rare away Test series victory for his side. He finished as the leading overall run scorer in the series with 413 runs, and was denied a double century only by rain,[citation needed] which encouraged skipper Brendon McCullum to declare in the interest of obtaining a result in the match. He was also reported for a suspect bowling action in April 2014, but was cleared in December 2014.[38] His illegal bowling action started after he left high school in order to get a faster release and turn on the ball.[citation needed] His new action essentially reverts him to his action in high school, with a more side-on approach and less wrist and elbow deviation.[citation needed] He was also named as captain ahead of the ODI and Twenty20 series against Pakistan as Brendon McCullum was rested.[39]

            Williamson scored 100* off 69 balls against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo, which at the time was the second fastest century by a New Zealander in a One-Day International.[40] He also established one of the most potent top-order partnership with Ross Taylor, with Williamson himself being the most prolific number-three batsman for the national side since former captain Stephen Fleming. As a fielder, his position is predominantly at gully.[citation needed]
            
            In 2015, he started with 69 and 242* against Sri Lanka, with two catches in the field in a man-of-the-match performance.[41] On 3 February 2015, he scored the 99th ODI century in the New Zealand's history, against Pakistan; Ross Taylor scored the 100th in the same match. He also scored over 700 runs before the 2015 Cricket World Cup in the first two months of the calendar year. On 17 June 2015 he became the fifth-fastest batsmen and fastest New Zealander to score 3,000 runs, getting them in just 78 innings. On 15 November 2015 Williamson and Taylor became the first pair of away batsmen to each score 2nd innings centuries at WACA Ground in Perth.[citation needed]
            
            In December 2015, during the second Test against Sri Lanka, Williamson broke the record for the most Test runs scored in a calendar year by a New Zealander, with 1172 runs.[42] He also ended 2015 with 2692 runs, the highest total across all forms of international cricket for the year, and third highest total in a single year.[43]
            
            He was awarded the T20 Player of the Year by NZC for the 2014–15 season.</p>
