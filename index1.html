        <p>Steven Peter Devereux Smith (born 2 June 1989) is an Australian international cricketer and former captain of the Australian national team in all three formats of the game. He is widely regarded as one of the best Test batsmen since Don Bradman, as well as one of the best in all formats in the history of the sport. [4] Smith was a member of the Australian teams that won the 2015 and 2023 Cricket World Cup, the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup, and the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final.</p>
        <h3>EARLY AND PERSONAL LIFE</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Steve Smith was born on 2 June 1989 in Kogarah, Sydney to an Australian father, Peter, who has a degree in chemistry,[6] and an English mother, Gillian. Smith attended Menai High School, and left at age 17 to play cricket in England where he played club cricket for Sevenoaks Vine in the Kent Cricket League. He did so well for Sevenoaks that he was picked to play for Surrey's second XI.[7][8][9]

            Because his mother was born in London, Smith has dual British and Australian citizenship.[10] In 2011, Smith started dating Dani Willis, a commerce and law student at Macquarie University.[11] In June 2017, the couple announced their engagement while on holiday in New York.[12] The couple married at Berrima, New South Wales on 15 September 2018.[13]</p>
        
        <h3>INTERNATIONAL CARRER</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>2010â€“2011: Debut and early international career
            Steve Smith made his international cricket debut in a Twenty20 International match playing as a leg spinner against Pakistan at Melbourne in February 2010. The same month, he made his One Day International debut against the West Indies also at Melbourne, playing in the fifth match of the series.[22]
            
            In the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 competition held in the West Indies, Australia finished runners up to England. Smith took 11 wickets in seven matches at an average of 14.81 to finish as the equal-second-highest wicket-taker of the tournament.[71]
      2013 tour of India. In the previous two Sheffield seasons his form had been middling, averaging 37, but he was chosen for the 17-man squad, primarily as a backup batsman, rather than an allrounder as he had been in the Test team previously.[76] Smith was selected for the third test in Mohali, his first in over two years, when four players were dropped for "not doing their homework", in a scandal known as Homeworkgate.[77][78][79]

            In the World Cup, Smith played a vital role as versatile batsman as he played in numerous batting positions from number three down to as a middle-order batsman. In Australia's opening match of the World Cup, against England, he was dismissed early on 5 but later improved as the tournament progressed. After making half centuries against Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he later steered Australia into the final after making a century against India in the semi-finals at the Sydney Cricket Ground.[128] In the final, Australia drew against fellow neighbours New Zealand after defeating South Africa. Australia's target to chase 183 runs after a New Zealand collapse saw Steve Smith score 58 not out alongside the skipper, Michael Clarke as Australia won by 7 wickets with 101 balls remaining.[129] Smith was Australia's highest run scorer in the tournament, scoring 402 runs at an average of 67, including a century and four fifties.[130] He was named in the team of the tournament for the 2015 World Cup by the ICC.[131] He was also named in the team of the tournament by ESPNcricinfo and Cricbuzz.[132][133]

            After winning the World Cup in March, Australia's winter schedule was later released with the Test team returned from their short break towards their two Test series against the West Indies in the Caribbean. Due to IPL commitments, Smith missed out on Australia's maiden warm up match against the West Indies Cricket Board President's XI on 27 May. He later joined the Test squad in the first Test match in Windsor Park, and scored 25 and 5 runs, respectively. In the second Test match in Sabina Park, Smith steered Australia to a first innings score of 399, where he made 199 and became the eighth man in Test history to be dismissed on 199.[134] Australia later won the match in positive fashion, beating the West Indies by 277 runs within four days and retained the Frank Worrell Trophy.[135] After his man of the match effort against the West Indies in the second Test, Smith became the second-youngest player ever to reach the number 1 ICC Test batsmen ranking and just the eighth Australian to do so.[136]</p>
